# 👋 Hi, I’m genzonline

**Software Engineer | Python Backend | Django | Data Pipelines**  

I’m a backend engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and building robust software systems — from **enterprise-scale Django applications** to **ETL pipelines** and **data warehouses**. I enjoy solving complex problems, writing maintainable code, and working on projects that demand both technical depth and clean architecture.

## 🛠 Current Interests
- Exploring **C** through small pet projects (HTTP servers, networking tools, CLI apps) to deepen my understanding of **systems programming**.  
- Building bridges between **high-level backend development** and **low-level systems knowledge** for long-term growth.
